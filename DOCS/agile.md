Everything is going to require a group of technologies and of skills coming together. So what you wanna figure out is who is the team, or who is the the company out there who can really guide you through a very large and complex technology ecosystem; and so a big part of it, so what we’ve been working on is creating recipes so that you’re not having to figure out, okay, what are all of the sensor companies out there? What are all the AI companies out there? What are the use cases involved? Heres a set of recipes that we have seen have success in your industry, and so you’re not having, you’re not having to have all the answers for yourself.

# PILOT
“we can have something that’s maybe we call it a pilot but isn’t going  to be scrapped.

# ROI
It’s actually the foundation for us scaling this thing up, having something that’s operational in a matter of weeks; 
that’s where people go, “okay, 

I can actually use this now, showcase what can be done quickly,” and then all of a sudden 
I’m able to bring that to the stakeholders involved. 
I’m able to bring that to the people controlling the way we wanna actually scale this so that we can say, 
“look, this is how much we’re able to do in a couple weeks here,” 
and now we see exactly what kind of ROI we’re able to get by implementing this at scale.
